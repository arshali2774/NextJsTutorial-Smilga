## Routing in NextJS

---

### Making routes

- Add a folder.
- The route will be the folder name.
  > **Example:** If we have a folder named about, then we can go to `localhost:3000/about`. Therefore "about" becomes a route.

### Navigation

- To navigate from one page to another we use the `Link` component from _NextJS_.
- It works like an _anchor tag_ in _HTML_.
